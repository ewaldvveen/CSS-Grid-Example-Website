# CSS Grid Example Website

I'm building this example site as a part of the Advanced CSS and SASS course by Jonas Schmedtmann. I'll use this readme file as a logfile to keep track of the progress I'm making on the course.

## Day 1 - 23 january 2018
I've created the grid layout of the page, so the structure of the site is already in place. After that I've started with building the Features section of the page. I've committed all the changes to this repository.

## Day 2 - 24 january 2018
Today I finished the Features section of the page and I made a start with the Story section. The content part of this section is already done, the image part needs to be build yet. All changes are committed to the repository.

## Day 3 - 27 january 2018
The story section is finished by now. I also made a start of the Homes section, a section with different cards of houses which will be a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox. All changes are committed to the repository.

## Day 4 - 28 january 2018
I completed the Home section, with CSS Grid and a tiny bit of Flexbox also. And again all changes are committed to the repository.

## Day 5 - 29 january 2018
I added a large image gallery (14 images) with the use of CSS Grid and the object-fit property. I've committed all the changes to this repository.

## Day 6 - 30 january 2018
The page contains a sidebare menu and a footer now. Besides these sections I also styled both the header parts. All updates files are committed to the repository.

## Day 7 - 1 february 2018
After adding some media queries to the project for a better responsive design I finished the course by adding the final CSS version. I really enjoyed this project and became a CSS Grid fan for sure!

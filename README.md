# CSS Grid Example Website

I'm building this example site as a part of the Advanced CSS and SASS course by Jonas Schmedtmann. I'll use this readme file as a logfile to keep track of the progress I'm making on the course.

## Day 1 - 23 janaury 2018
I've created the grid layout of the page, so the structure of the site is already in place. After that I've started with building the Features section of the page. I've committed all the changes to this repository.
